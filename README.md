# Vulnerability-management
This is a prototype for a vulnerability management tool, directly implementing the CVE-Search database for automating the
creation of tickets.

##Installation:
###Requirements
You will need to install postgresql to your repository. It should be in your default repository. On Ubuntu, just type `apt-get install postgresql` in a terminal window.< br />
You will also need to install `psycopg2` using `sudo pip3 install psycopg2`. A requirements file for `pip3` will soon follow
###Setting up the database
**Optional modifications:** <br />
If you want, you can change the data at the top of `install/createPostgresDB.py`. Read carefully what you can and cannot edit, and proceed at your own risk. <br />
<br />
**Installation:** <br />
 * `cd install`
 * `sudo su - postgres`
 * `<create database>`
 * `exit`
 * `python3 createPostgresDB.py`
 * **Optionally:** `python3 testDataPostgres.py` - add test-data like default users, teams and systems to the database


**NOTE** This tool is still in development, and is not yet operational!
**NOTE** Currently, we are only supporting PostgreSQL as a database. If you want support for other database types, we encourage
 you to help us build database layers for all sorts of databases.
